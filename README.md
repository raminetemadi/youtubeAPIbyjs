# youtubeAPIbyjs
Hi 
This is a very simple search on Youtube example by Javascript. Currently this code has following features :
- Search on Youtube
- Show 20 records in every page
- Using Youtube API v 3.0
- Technologies : LESS, Javascript, API
- Every video item is http://schema.org/ enabled

This is a 2 hours task butI hope can improve it and add more feature, in next future.

Thanks,
Ramin.
